                <p className='heading3'>2. Cancellation Policy</p>
                <p>2.1. Cancellation of orders refers to orders that are pending fulfilment. The terms below apply to Products held in stock, and to made-to-order items, and include Products stored or held outside of the India.</p>
                <p>2.2. To ensure delivery of the desired Products in the shortest lead time, Ulinkit begins processing orders from the moment they are confirmed. Hence a request to cancel or change an order may not be feasible or acceptable in certain cases. Furthermore, logistics, locked-in pricing for ordered products and obligations toward third party suppliers may impact Ulinkit’s ability to accept a cancellation or change request. Therefore, please read the below carefully and contact us if you have any queries.</p>
                <p>2.3. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Policy:</p>
                <p>• The Buyer and Seller may, by mutual written consent, agree to cancel an order. This will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis at Ulinkit’s discretion.</p>
                <p>• The Seller may cancel an order without obligation, liability to, or consent from the Buyer.</p>
                <p>• Buyers may cancel orders soon after they are placed. Once the order status reads “ready to ship”, the Buyer will no longer be able to proceed with a Cancellation.</p>
                <p>• Buyers may cancel delayed orders after 2 days past the estimated delivery date, and an automatic Refund will be initiated.</p>
                <p>2.4 Once an order is already delivered, cancelation is no longer possible, the customer would have to submit a return request with a valid reason based on the Policy.</p>
                <p>2.5 Changing or cancelling orders cannot be accepted when “same day shipping” or “express” is specified in the order.</p>
                <p className='heading3'>3. Special large quantity orders</p>
                <p>3.1. Cancellation of special large quantity orders shall not be acceptable unless specifically agreed in writing between the Buyer and Seller.</p>
                <p>3.2. To request the Cancellation of an order, the Buyer must send a request in writing to Ulinkit via email or the appropriate Platform functionality, requesting to cancel all or part of a non-executed (or pending) order which has a status labelled "Pending Fulfilment". The Buyer can also cancel the order directly on its Ulinkit account within the relevant Cancellation window mentioned in paragraph 5 of this Policy.</p>
                <p>3.3. Upon receiving such notification, the Seller shall stop any work in respect of said order and advise the Buyer, in writing, of whether the Cancellation can be accepted (including any applicable conditions for such cancellation).</p>
                <p>3.4. Where a Cancellation request has been approved but the Seller has already incurred costs and expenses that cannot reasonably be recovered through the sale of the products to another Buyer, the Buyer will pay the Seller for all such costs and expenses, which may include costs of related raw materials, packaging, shipping and any other costs or expenses related to the order fulfilment. In such cases, the Seller may deduct such costs from any amounts pre-paid by the Buyer, or otherwise held on the Buyer’s account.</p>

                <p>4.1. Unless further restrictions apply as specified in the sections below, or otherwise specifically agreed in writing between the Buyer and Ulinkit, Returns will be processed only if:</p>
                <p>• It is determined that the Product was damaged in transit.</p>
                <p>• The Product is returned in the same condition as when it was received (sealed/unopened, if applicable, with the original brand /manufacturer box or packaging, and, if applicable, any user manual, warranty card, and all accessories)</p>
                <p>4.2. Items marked as "non-returnable" or “custom-made” on the product detail page cannot be returned. However, in an unlikely event that a damaged, defective or wrong Product is delivered to the Buyer, Ulinkit will provide a full refund or replacement, as applicable. Ulinkit may contact the Buyer to further investigate the damage to, or defect in, the Product prior to issuing the Refund or replacement.

                <p>4.3. Frozen Items, fresh foods, or chilled foods and beverages must be inspected at the time of receipt. Buyers must inform Ulinkit’s delivery agent of their rejection of the Product at the time of delivery in the unlikely event of receiving an unsatisfactory item.</p>

                <p>6.4. If the Return is initiated without any error on the part of Ulinkit or the Seller (e.g. due to Buyer's preference or sizing expectations), the Buyer will not be eligible for a Refund on shipping fees. However, if the Items received are not as described on Ulinkit (damaged, incorrect in quantity, or an error in the Item’s sizing/color), the shipping fee will be refundable to the Buyer.</p>

                <p>7.1.

                <p>9.2. In the event Buyers are found to misuse this Policy by excessively returning Products, or returning Products which are not in their original condition, or by repetitively cancelling or not accepting the orders placed, Ulinkit reserves the right to warn, restrict, suspend, block and/or terminate such Buyer accounts, as necessary.</p>
                <p>9.3. will not accept Returns of any Products which are wrongfully sent back to Ulinkit, or Products which differ from what was originally delivered to the Buyer. This includes Products which were not originally purchased from Ulinkit. In the event Ulinkit receives such Products, Ulinkit will not provide a Refund or any other concession in respect of such Products, and the Buyer’s actions may result in restrictions on its Ulinkit account including limiting its ability to return Products or cancel orders in the future. Any such Products which the Buyer returns to Ulinkit may not be shipped or otherwise returned to the Buyer. Ulinkit will only process a Return in respect of Products which were originally delivered to the Buyer, in accordance with this Policy.</p>
                <p>9.4. Ulinkit reserves the right to reject a Return or Refund request if the reason for such request is not in line with this Policy. In such cases, Ulinkit will not issue a Refund for the Products nor the delivery fees. Ulinkit is not responsible for Items erroneously contained within a returned package, or for any data breach resulting from failure to eliminate personal data contained in a returned Product.</p>
                <p>9.5. For rejected Refund requests, Ulinkit will make two attempts to redeliver the Products to the Buyer. Should the redelivery attempts be unsuccessful, Ulinkit shall hold the Products for 30 days before disposing of the same.</p>

Upon collection, the Buyer shall inspect the Products and sign a document confirming receipt of the Products.

                <p>10.3. If a Buyer chooses the COD payment method, and does not pick up an order at the scheduled collection timeslot, the order will be cancelled after 48 hours of the scheduled collection time, without notice.</p>
