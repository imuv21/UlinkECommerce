                <div className='heading3'>2. Cancellation Policy</div>
                <div>2.1. Cancellation of orders refers to orders that are pending fulfilment. The terms below apply to Products held in stock, and to made-to-order items, and include Products stored or held outside of the India.</div>
                <div>2.2. To ensure delivery of the desired Products in the shortest lead time, Ulinkit begins processing orders from the moment they are confirmed. Hence a request to cancel or change an order may not be feasible or acceptable in certain cases. Furthermore, logistics, locked-in pricing for ordered products and obligations toward third party suppliers may impact Ulinkit’s ability to accept a cancellation or change request. Therefore, please read the below carefully and contact us if you have any queries.</div>
                <div>2.3. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Policy:</div>
                <div>• The Buyer and Seller may, by mutual written consent, agree to cancel an order. This will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis at Ulinkit’s discretion.</div>
                <div>• The Seller may cancel an order without obligation, liability to, or consent from the Buyer.</div>
                <div>• Buyers may cancel orders soon after they are placed. Once the order status reads “ready to ship”, the Buyer will no longer be able to proceed with a Cancellation.</div>
                <div>• Buyers may cancel delayed orders after 2 days past the estimated delivery date, and an automatic Refund will be initiated.</div>
                <div>2.4 Once an order is already delivered, cancelation is no longer possible, the customer would have to submit a return request with a valid reason based on the Policy.</div>
                <div>2.5 Changing or cancelling orders cannot be accepted when “same day shipping” or “express” is specified in the order.</div>
                <div className='heading3'>3. Special large quantity orders</div>
                <div>3.1. Cancellation of special large quantity orders shall not be acceptable unless specifically agreed in writing between the Buyer and Seller.</div>
                <div>3.2. To request the Cancellation of an order, the Buyer must send a request in writing to Ulinkit via email or the appropriate Platform functionality, requesting to cancel all or part of a non-executed (or pending) order which has a status labelled "Pending Fulfilment". The Buyer can also cancel the order directly on its Ulinkit account within the relevant Cancellation window mentioned in paragraph 5 of this Policy.</div>
                <div>3.3. Upon receiving such notification, the Seller shall stop any work in respect of said order and advise the Buyer, in writing, of whether the Cancellation can be accepted (including any applicable conditions for such cancellation).</div>
                <div>3.4. Where a Cancellation request has been approved but the Seller has already incurred costs and expenses that cannot reasonably be recovered through the sale of the products to another Buyer, the Buyer will pay the Seller for all such costs and expenses, which may include costs of related raw materials, packaging, shipping and any other costs or expenses related to the order fulfilment. In such cases, the Seller may deduct such costs from any amounts pre-paid by the Buyer, or otherwise held on the Buyer’s account.</div>

                <div>4.1. Unless further restrictions apply as specified in the sections below, or otherwise specifically agreed in writing between the Buyer and Ulinkit, Returns will be processed only if:</div>

                <div>• The Product is returned in the same condition as when it was received (sealed/unopened, if applicable, with the original brand /manufacturer box or packaging, and, if applicable, any user manual, warranty card, and all accessories)</div>
                <div>4.2. Items marked as "non-returnable" or “custom-made” on the product detail page cannot be returned. However, in an unlikely event that a damaged, defective or wrong Product is delivered to the Buyer, Ulinkit will provide a full refund or replacement, as applicable.

                <div>6.4. If the Return is initiated without any error on the part of Ulinkit or the Seller (e.g. due to Buyer's preference or sizing expectations), the Buyer will not be eligible for a Refund on shipping fees.

Any such Products which the Buyer returns to Ulinkit may not be shipped or otherwise returned to the Buyer. Ulinkit will only process a Return in respect of Products which were originally delivered to the Buyer, in accordance with this Policy.</div>
                <div>9.4. Ulinkit reserves the right to reject a Return or Refund request if the reason for such request is not in line with this Policy.

                <div>9.5. For rejected Refund requests, Ulinkit will make two attempts to redeliver the Products to the Buyer. Should the redelivery attempts be unsuccessful, Ulinkit shall hold the Products for 30 days before disposing of the same.</div>
